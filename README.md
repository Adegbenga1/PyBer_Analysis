The data frame showed comprehensive information on the cities fare with respect to city types, number of drivers and 
behaviour patterns of fares.

This results  summarized how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
It was evident from details of Total fare by City Type is high in urban city compared to suburban and rural cities.
There were spikes in fare prices for all city types towards the end of the month of February.A deep drop was also noticed
on the first day of March for all city types. this could be used for effective planning if we are able to determine the

Results could be used for micro and macro economic planning for the support of economic growth through logistics transportation planning.

# Summary
1. Urban cities looks promising for increase in market shares . This can be attributed to globalization and availability of job opportunities 
and recreational facilities. Therefore, strategic plans must always be in place to harness every opprtunity that will enhance high
return on investments.
2. Investing in rural cities will not generate returns as seen in urban and suburban cities probably due to migration. Indepth market analysis
 is required to assess operational environment and deduce the potential prospectsin establshing industries in those cities
3. Continous monitoring of demand trends will provide better opportunities for effective fares planning . Months with higher fares should 
be reviewed and outcomes must be shared with stakeholders for better business decisions
